## Dataset

The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers. Each sample has four features:

- Sepal length

- Sepal width

- Petal length

- Petal width

The dataset contains three species of Iris flowers:

- Iris setosa

- Iris versicolor

- Iris virginica

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**

   - Load the Iris dataset.

   - Explore the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of features.

2. **Data Preparation:**

   - Encode the categorical target variable (species) into numerical values.

   - Optionally, scale the features.

3. **Model Training:**

   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

   - Train a Decision Tree classifier on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   - Evaluate the model using accuracy as the primary metric.

   - Use cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model.

5. **Visualization:**

   - Visualize the trained Decision Tree for better interpretability.

   - Create a correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships.

6. **Prediction:**

   - Predict the species of new Iris flower samples using the trained model.
